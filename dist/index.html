      <h1>hi, i'm alex</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a computer science and engineering (course 6-3) student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, class of 2028.
      </p><p>
        I've worked at a NASA wind tunnel, tracked a near earth asteriod, fine-tuned a LLM to help researchers write papers, 
        and helped build planes from 6 inches to 12 feet in wingspan. 
      </p><p>
        I'm interested in working in aerospace on autonomy. 
      </p><p>
        I love eating tuna sashimi, photographing birds, writing sci-fi, and obsessing over anything that flies.
